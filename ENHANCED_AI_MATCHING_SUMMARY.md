# Enhanced AI Matching System - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Successfully implemented **Point 2 (Text Compatibility Analysis)** and **Point 3 (Overall Compatibility Reasoning)** using advanced LLM-based system prompts for your dating app.

## âœ… What Was Added

### 1. **LLM-Based Text Compatibility Analysis**
- **Location**: `app/services/ai_matching.py` - `get_llm_text_compatibility()` method
